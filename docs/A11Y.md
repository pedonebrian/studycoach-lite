# Accessibility Practices

- All interactive elements use semantic HTML (button, link, input).
- Radix primitives ensure keyboard navigation and focus management.
- Color choices checked with contrast ratios â‰¥ WCAG AA.
- Forms labeled with `aria-label` or `<label for>`.
- Storybook includes `@storybook/addon-a11y` to run accessibility checks in dev.
- Playwright + Axe runs on CI for automated audits.
